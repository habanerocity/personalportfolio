  paragraphs: [
    "Hiring an experienced web developer is more than just getting your website up and running—it’s about building a powerful online presence that’s tailored to your brand’s goals. While DIY website builders such as Wix or Squarespace offer quick setups, they come with significant limitations. Unlike WordPress, these platforms often restrict customization, performance, and scalability, which can hinder your growth in the long run.",
    "When you work with a professional WordPress developer, you get a fully customized website that can reflect your unique brand identity and meets your specific business needs. Unlike DIY tools, which rely on pre-built templates, I can design and build you a WordPress theme with custom code that’s tailored to your audience and optimized for performance, security, and SEO. This ensures your customers can easily find you, trust you, and convert into loyal clients.",
    "As a business owner, your time is best spent on what you do best—running your business. Hiring a web developer allows you to leave the technical aspects of website development to a professional, so you can focus on driving sales and growing your brand. You get the peace of mind that your website is being expertly handled while you concentrate on your strengths.",
    "An experienced developer doesn’t just launch your website and walk away. I provide ongoing technical support, maintenance, and updates, ensuring your WordPress website remains secure, up-to-date, and functions smoothly as technology evolves. Security is a top priority—I implement WordPress security best practices and other key measures to protect your site from potential threats."
