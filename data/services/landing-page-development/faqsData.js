      question: "Why do I need a custom landing page instead of using a DIY builder like Wix or Squarespace?",
      answer: "Custom-coded landing pages offer better performance, unlimited customization, and higher conversions than template-based builders. DIY tools often have bloated code, slower load times, and limited functionality. A professional developer (like me!) ensures your page is fast, SEO-optimized, and tailored to your brand’s unique goals—without recurring platform fees."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to build a landing page?",
      answer: "Timelines vary based on complexity, but most projects take 2-4 weeks from design to launch. This includes strategy, development, testing, and optimization. Need it faster? Ask me about rush projects!"
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with existing designs, or do you create them from scratch?",
      answer: "Both! I can convert your Figma/PSD designs into a fully functional landing page, design from scratch using UI/UX best practices, and optimize or redesign your current landing page for better results."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure my landing page converts well?",
      answer: "I focus on: clear benefit-driven copy that speaks to your audience, strategic call-to-actions, trust signals (testimonials, guarantees, etc.), a/b testing (optional) to refine messaging and layout."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you charge hourly rates or flat rates per project?",
      answer: "I offer flexible payment options, including hourly rates, flat rates per project, and monthly retainers. While I prefer project-based pricing to ensure the best results aligned with the value I provide, each project is unique. For a custom quote, feel free to send me an inquiry—I'm happy to provide a free consultation to discuss your needs and offer a personalized estimate."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle SEO for landing pages?",
      answer: "Yes! I optimize for on-page SEO, including keyword research and placement, meta tags, headings, and alt text. All of my landing pages are mobile-responsive and have a crawlable code structure, plus analytics setup to track performance."
    },
    {
      question: "What ongoing support do you offer after launch?",
      answer: "I provide maintenance packages for technical updates, content/design tweaks, Google Analytics reviews to track conversions, and domain/hosting support (if needed)."
